Changes made to the code are: 
1. Adding Maximum and Minimum character limits and letting the code decide a random character limit between the max and min.
2. Adding if numbers are required in the password with a yes or no question the user has to answer. 
3. Adding if special characters are required in the password with a yes or no question the user has to answer. 
4. Adding separate loops for numbers and special characters. 
5. Changed the overall user experience by specifying the password requirements. 
6. Adding an error message if the user doesn't input the correct options.
